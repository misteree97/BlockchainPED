Compilation Instructions (Let us know if you cannot run it.):

Instructions for setting up the testnet are on the paper (It's difficult to describe in a few steps.)

1. Install Ganache at https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
2. (Assuming Chrome is used) Download Metamask from  the chrome store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en
3. Install Node.js if it isn't already installed at https://nodejs.org/en/
4. Unzip our project into a directory of your choice.
5. Navigate to the newly unzipped project with a terminal of your choice.
6. Run "npm install truffle"
7. Ensure the port of localhost is the same as the one specified by Ganache.
8. Open chrome at localhost:PORT where PORT is the port number specified.
